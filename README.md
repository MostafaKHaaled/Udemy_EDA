<center style="color:#FFD700;font-size:25px">the insights form this project </center><br>
<ul style="color:#ff0000;font-size:18px">
    <li>most courses that have most student count not have 5 stars rating</li><br>
    <li>lecture count and course duration have Simple impact on main_price</li><br>
    <li>We knew that top 20 popular courses are long-term. Maybe so many people enroll the long-term courses because they think they can find the information they're looking for with these.</li><br>
    <li>What improvement can we improve if we leave the course price dependent on the reviws_avg and reviwe_count</li>
    <li>Most of the discounts range between 80 and 90, and according to the price of the course. The lower the price, the lower the percentage</li><br>
    <li>Actually, I found that the size of the description affects the number of students who enroll in the course, and that depends on the price of the course, and that most of them are registered at the time of discounts</li>
